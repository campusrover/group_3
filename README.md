# Stuff to consider:

# How will the robot see the walls?
#     - Mapping of some kind...?
#         - Draw a way forward
#     - Computer vision?
#         - Go into "open space"

# How will it know to move fast?
#     - Always be moving at 1 speed
#     - Never be not moving at 1 speed

How can a car avoid another?
    - The car in front has the right of way
    - Following cars need a big speed advantage over leading ones
    - Two "lanes" that are invisible
    - Robots drive in "inner0" lan most of the time, if overtaking switch to outer

Sub-problems
    - 

Dancing

Patterns
    - Robots move in concentric circles
    - Robots, from an unorganized position, form a line
    - Robots form vertices of shape (if there are enough)
    - Robots mix about in a disorganized manner but don't collide
    - Sync with some music (dance more or less in place)
    - Robots drive towards each other, stop, turn around, and drive away
    - 
    

Sub-problems
    - Localize one robot with fiducials 
    - Get ROScore to run on only one bot and link another bot to it (and whatever computer the vnc runs on)
    - Publish tf2s from each robot with relative dist to the map coords
    - Have robots move in some simple pattern
    - Add more patterns
